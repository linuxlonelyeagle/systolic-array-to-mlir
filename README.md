# systolic-array-to-mlir
A repository for learning systolic-array and mlir.The code for this repository comes from [here](https://github.com/hngenc/systolic-array)，you can can find out more through the link.I just rewrote the systolic array using the latest chisel because I wanted to have a deeper understanding of systolic array, and I also wanted to explore further on mlir(circt) because chisel now provides an interface to generate mlir.
                                                                                                                                                              Finally, thanks to Hasan Genc！
